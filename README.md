I have solved problems in Python Language

Problem-1 : 
First we Define the Calculator class to perform basic arithmetic operations then Initialize the calculator with two numbers and the desired operation then Perform the calculation based on the specified operation
Prompt the user to enter two numbers and enter the desired operation. Create a Calculator object with the provided inputs Perform the calculation and display the result.

Problem-2 :
This Python script prompts the user to input a number, then generates a list of the first n odd numbers using list comprehension. It multiplies each index by 2 and adds 1 to produce the odd numbers. The resulting list is then printed as a comma-separated string.

Problem-3 :
This Python script prompts the user to input a number, then calculates the largest odd number less than or equal to that number. It then prints all odd numbers from 1 up to this calculated number, each followed by a comma, except for the last number. The end parameter in the print function ensures that commas are added between numbers, but not after the last one.

Problem-4 :
This Python script prompts the user to input a list of numbers and counts how many times each digit from 1 to 9 appears as a divisor of any number in the list. It iterates through each number and checks divisibility for digits 1 through 9. The results are stored in a dictionary, where keys are digits and values are their respective counts.
