I have solved problems in Python Language

Problem-1 : 
First we Define the Calculator class to perform basic arithmetic operations then Initialize the calculator with two numbers and the desired operation then Perform the calculation based on the specified operation
Prompt the user to enter two numbers and enter the desired operation. Create a Calculator object with the provided inputs Perform the calculation and display the result.

Problem-2 :
Prompt the user to enter a number then Generate a list of the first 'a' odd numbers using list comprehension then Print the list as a comma-separated string

Problem-3 :
Prompt the user to enter a number then Determine the largest odd number less than or equal to 'a' then Print all odd numbers from 1 up to 'count'.

Problem-4 :
Create Function to count how many times each digit from 1 to 9 divides any number in the list then Initialize an empty dictionary to store count. Iterate through each number in the list Check divisibility for digits 1 through 9 If 'i' divides 'num' without remainder If 'i' is already in the dictionary Initialize its count to Return the dictionary with counts Accepting user input and converting it into a list of integers
